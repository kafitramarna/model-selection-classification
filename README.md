# Classification Models

## Description
This project involves the implementation and evaluation of various classification models to predict a target variable based on a dataset. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and test sets, scaled, and then used to train and evaluate multiple models. The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Languages or Tools
- Python
- Google Colab

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Best Performing Model

The **Decision Tree Classification** and **Random Forest Classification** models achieved the highest accuracy of 97.08%. Both models demonstrated excellent performance, with high precision, recall, and f1-scores across both classes. These models are particularly effective for this dataset and can be considered the best performing based on the results.
